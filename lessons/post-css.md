 ### What Is PostCSS?

[Github Source Code](https://github.com/postcss/postcss)  
[Documentation](http://postcss.org/)  

PostCSS is a way to transform your stylesheets using JS plugins that do literally anything you can think of related to CSS.

Some examples include linting CSS with helpful error messages, dealing with inline images in user-friendly ways, guarding against future CSS code and reverse-compatability, handling cross-browser issues, etc.  

The library currently boasts over 200 plugins that do a plethora of fun things. No joke. Remember that time you were writing CSS and you were like "UGHHHH I WISH CENTERING AN ELEMENT VERTICALLY ON THE PAGE WASNT A GIANT PAIN IN THE ASS!". Here you go: [postcss-center](https://github.com/jedmao/postcss-center).
