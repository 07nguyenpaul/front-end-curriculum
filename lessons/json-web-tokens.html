### Goals

By the end of this lesson, you will:

- have a basic understanding of token-based authentication
- be able to implement authentication using JWT and Auth0

## Token-Based Authentication
Secure authentication is a vital aspect of many applications. While traditional oAuth methods can be difficult to understand, some alternative solutions have made this process easier for developers. We're already familiar with [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), which provides 3rd-party authentication as one of its many features. In this lesson, we'll learn how to authenticate our Node + Express applications with JSON Web Tokens, using Auth0.

## JSON Web Tokens
JSON Web Tokens, JWTs for short, provide us with a compact way to securely transmit data encoded as a JSON object. JSON objects are simple and compact, making them easy to pass along as query strings, headers, and request bodies.
