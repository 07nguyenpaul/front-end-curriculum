### Goals

By the end of this lesson, you will:

- have a basic understanding of token-based authentication
- be able to secure a basic node/express app with JWTs

## Token-Based Authentication
Secure authentication is a vital aspect of many applications. While traditional oAuth methods can be difficult to understand, some alternative solutions have made this process easier for developers. We're already familiar with [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), which provides 3rd-party authentication as one of its many features. In this lesson, we'll learn how to secure our Node and Express applications with JSON Web Tokens.

## JSON Web Tokens
JSON Web Tokens, JWTs for short, provide us with a compact way to securely transmit data encoded as a JSON object. JSON objects are simple and compact, making them easy to pass along as query strings, headers, and request bodies. Similar to API Keys that help verify access to an API, JSON web tokens look something like this:

```javascript
eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.
eyJtZXNzYWdlIjoiSldUIFJ1bGVzISIsImlhdCI6MTQ1OTQ0ODExOSwiZXhwIjoxNDU5NDU0NTE5fQ.
