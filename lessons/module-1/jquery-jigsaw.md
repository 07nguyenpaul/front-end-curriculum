## Learning Goals

* Use jQuery selectors to find content
* Understand that jQuery collections allow you to manipulate multiple elements with a single method
* Use jQuery's DOM traversal methods to move around the DOM
* Add CSS styles using jQuery
* Append new content to the DOM
* Add event listeners to elements currently in the DOM
* Understand that adding an event listener will not effect elements you add to the DOM in the future

## Structure

### Introduction (5 minutes)

What is a jigsaw lesson? What is the purpose? What can't you just talk at us like usual?...

### Warm Up (10 minutes)

Review the base prework as a group:

* [What is jQuery?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2mFyPxL-fU)
* [Why is it still important?](http://www.learningjquery.com/2015/02/5-reasons-to-use-jquery)
* [The basics of jQuery and the selector.](https://medium.com/@jaeger.rob/jquery-selectors-the-absolute-basics-d781500c722c#.q6q4j61fj)

### Research (35 minutes)

In this session your goal is to build expertise in your group's subject area. Get into your specified "Research Groups". During this time your group is collaborating to put together a collection of notes and key understandings such as:

* What is this thing?
* Why is it useful?
* How do you put it into action?
* Put together a short demo (less than 3 minutes).
* How can it affect your development process?
* Are there any downsides to using it?
* Where can a person go to learn more about it? Any resources seem better than others?

### Break

### Expert Presentations (10 minutes for each subject area)

Combine into your specified “Learning Groups”. You should have one person from each of the Research Groups. A representative from each of the research groups will take turns sharing their findings from the respective content areas as follows:

* Clear, concise definition(s) of the subject matter and its importance
* Concrete example(s) of when to use, employ, consider
* Any concerns and/or things to watch out for
* Create a short demo-able code example to share
* Optional/additional resources for independent study

While they’re sharing, the rest of the group should:

* Take their own notes
* Ask clarifying questions
* Brainstorm/record any depth questions the researcher is not able to answer
* Assign a time keeper to WATCH THE CLOCK :alarm_clock: so the presenter doesn’t have to keep track, and the group ends up with a comprehensive set of notes, understandings, and questions across each of the subjects by the end of the session

### Break

### Gather Questions (10 minutes)

Have one person from each Learning Group write that group’s unanswered questions on the front board.

### Review Questions (30 minutes)

Let's review and attempt to answer all the questions on the board together.

## Homework (Additional Resources)

Go through [this lesson](http://frontend.turing.io/lessons/module-1/introduction-to-jquery.html) to review jQuery and get more practice actually using the library.

## Content

### Selectors

* Start here: [The basics of jQuery and the selector.](https://medium.com/@jaeger.rob/jquery-selectors-the-absolute-basics-d781500c722c#.q6q4j61fj)
* How do you write a basic jQuery selector? How does it differ from using vanilla JavaScript?
* What data type does the jQuery selector syntax use?
* How do you select HTML elements using element names, ID, or class?
* What are the different ways to chain selectors? For instance, how would you select an element with the class of “bordered-content” and “ad-aside”?
* How do you select based on element attributes?
* How do you select based on the state of a checkbox or radio button?
* What does the jQuery selector return? You can use this for more in-depth research: http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/jquery-object/

### Getting and Setting Content Values

### Events

### jQuery Docs

### DOM Traversal
