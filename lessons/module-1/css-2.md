# Content
Today we're going to try a "jigsaw" approach to exploring four topics across six short sessions. 

## Content Areas
Each student will be a part of a Research Group investigating one of the following:

### Reset v. Normalize CSS Files

### Image Optimization

### Performance & Organization

### Transitions, Transformations, Animations

# Session 1: Warmup
For warmup, before you get into your Research Group, spend ten minutes getting your feet wet with your research topic.

# Session 1: Research
In this session your goal is to "build expertise". Gather into your "Research Groups" specified in the outline. During this time you're group is collaborating to put together a collection of notes / key understandings such as:

* What is this thing?
* Who makes it / where does it come from?
* Why is it useful?
* Who uses it?
* How do you put it into action?
* How do you get / interpret the results?
* Put together a short demo (less than 3 minutes)
* How can it affect your development process?
* Are there any downsides to using it?
* Where can a person go to learn more about it? Any resources seem better than others?

Each person from the "Research Group" needs to finish session 1 with their own set of notes and their demo ready to go.
