## Module Overview
Welcome! We are excited to share the first six weeks of the program with you. As the first of four modules in the Front End program this six weeks is about developing a solid foundation in the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Additionally, we’ll introduce you to test driven development, version control, and object oriented programming. Module one also includes an introduction to Turing citizenship via special curriculum in community Fridays for mod-1 students and professional development courses to help cultivate your personal brand in anticipation of entering the job market as a front end engineer.

## Inclusivity Statement
We understand our community members represent a rich variety of backgrounds and perspectives. Turing is committed to providing an atmosphere for learning that respects diversity. While working together to build this community we ask all members to:

* share their unique experiences, values and beliefs
* be open to the views of others 
* honor the uniqueness of their fellow members
* appreciate the opportunity that we have to learn from each other in this
community
* value each other’s opinions and communicate in a respectful manner
* use this opportunity together to discuss ways in which we can create an
* inclusive environment at Turing and across the tech community at large

## Module Aims
By the end of module one, students will:

#### General

* Understand how the internet works and the roles of HTML, CSS, and JS in front end engineering. 
* Understand the what, why, and how of code libraries. 
* Exhibit comfort using terminal to navigate through directories, adding and moving files 

#### HTML

* Use semantic tags. 
* Write well structured markup w/ proper nesting.
* Follow style and naming conventions.
* Create forms using correct structure and form elements 

#### CSS

* Understand and leverage cascading styles. 
* Know when to use ids and classes, & add multiple classes in markup. 
* Write idiomatic css. 
* Understand positioning and employ various approaches appropriately. 
* Understand and implement responsive layouts. 
* Use css animations practically for user interactions. 
* Understand basic performance issues introduced by CSS. 
* Use devtools effectively to debug & read error messages. 

#### Javascript

* Exhibit a solid grasp of syntax, such that syntax does not inhibit student’s progress, but the occasional quick reference is fine.
* Use devtools to debug & read error messages, specifically: setting breakpoints, using sources to watch/evaluate code, making use of console to test data and code.
* Understand scope, this binding, and how to use it effectively.
* Strong foundation in accessing data through arrays and objects (In/Out, transform).
* Communicate coding solutions/questions w/ correct terminology.
* Fundamental Code Concepts: variable assignment, functions, arguments/parameters, objects, arrays, data-types, local storage, conditionals/operators, DOM.
* Array prototypes: students know the different methods and use them appropriately in a variety of circumstances.
* Understand how browsers interpret/read code.
* Understand the reason for jQuery and how to leverage it.
* Understand how event bubbling and delegation work, and exhibit that understanding in manipulation of the DOM.

#### Testing

* Understand the what and why for testing libraries and difference between test runner and assertion library.
* Experience in writing tests in mocha/chai and can unit test
functions.
* Employ cross browser testing regularly throughout development.
* Leverage test failure messages to debug and diagnose issues.

#### Refactoring

* Refactor large functions into smaller functions.
* Avoid the crutch of global variables.
* Think/Write with an SRP mindset, and employ purposeful naming conventions/naming style in refactoring.
* Lean toward working/functioning first, and not abstracting too early, but can identify opportune times in which to stop and refactor.

## Module Format & Expectations
Module one can be overwhelming as you find yourself adjusting to a new routine, challenging curriculum, and assimilating into a new community. We have a lot to accomplish in a concentrated period. Below you will find a breakout of curriculum and assignments per week. Other expectations include:

### Overview

| Attendance & Tardiness| Class begins promptly at 9:00 AM for the morning session, and 1:00 PM for the afternoon session. You are expected to be on time and in attendance every day. We understand issues arise, and ask that you communicate with instructors when you are going to be late or absent. |
| 1:1's| These are 15 minute checkins with instructors to discuss how things are going in the program and if you have any concerns/questions.|
| Evals | Per project assessments that should be included in your portfolio.|
|Mid Mock Assessment| This assessment is not included in your portfolio, but is prep for the final assessment week.|
|Quizlette| Weekly pop quiz questions.|
|Pentathlon| Week six of the program, coined the “Pentathlon”, is a summative assessment to determine your eligibility to advance to module two. The assessment is comprised of two coding challenges, a comprehensive quizlette, game time evaluations, and your portfolio defense.|
|Portfolio Defense| A portfolio summarizes your individual, team, and community accomplishments. Detailed information [here](https://github.com/turingschool/portfolios).|
|Community Fridays| As a valuable member of the community, we expect your participation and engagement in Friday events.|
