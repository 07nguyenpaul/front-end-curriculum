### Professional Skills

The Professional Skills segment is made up of several pieces, all of which are to be submitted by 9AM on Monday of Week 6. It's suggested that you send them earlier if possible.

Students are to begin their job hunt and submit evidence of:

* Summaries of at least 6 "cold outreach" contacts [submitted via email to Meg](mailto:mstewart@turing.io). While not due until the deadline, we're recommending that you complete two by the end of week 3, two by the end of week 4, and two by the end of week 5. Submit summaries/notes as you hit those checkpoints.
* Following up on the *Organize Your Shit* session, ensure that your GitHub, LinkedIn, and StackOverflow accounts are properly setup by linking to them in your Census account. We will run an automated check on these and send you a follow up if needed. No submission is necessary beyond putting the info in your Census account.
* Following up on the *Portfolio Tips & Tricks* tutorial, notify [Meg via email](mailto:mstewart@turing.io) that your portfolio is complete with your name, photo, description, three projects, and resume.
* Participate in at least one practice technical interview or one actual external interview. [Email Meg](mailto:mstewart@turing.io) a summary with the company, interviewer's name, and their title.
