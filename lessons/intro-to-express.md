### Goals

By the end of this lesson, you will:

* Understand when and why to use Express.js in the back-end of an application
* Know how Express.js abstracts difficult server-side logic and makes it easier to write endpoints

## What is Express?

Think about how and why we use jQuery on the front-end. Vanilla JavaScript can be verbose and difficult to read. jQuery came along to give developers a nicer-looking syntax to perform the same operations. It was a library built to abstract the trickier parts of JavaScript and make them easier to write and work with. Express was built for very similar reasons.

Just like browser-based JavaScript, the syntax for using plain Node.js isn't the friendliest. Node gives you enough low-level features to build the back-end of an application, but Express is a light layer built on top of Node to make these low-level features a little easier to read and write.
