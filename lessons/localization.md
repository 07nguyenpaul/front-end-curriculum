### Goals

By the end of this lesson, you will:

* know the difference between localization and internationalization
* be able to accurately detect a user's locale and serve up an appropriate translation
* understand the strategies and patterns that make an app easily localizable

### What is Localization/Internationalization?
Localization is the process of adapting an existing website to local language and culture. Internationalization describes patterns, strategies and conventions an application should use in order to facilitate easier localization in the future. While not every app you build will need to be localized, it's important to keep internationalization strategies in mind when building an app that may need to reach wider audiences in the future.

Many people mistakenly believe localization simply refers to rendering the page text in multiple languages. In reality, it's a bit more involved than that.

You'll often hear of these terms alongside their library counterparts: l10n and i18n. l10n is a localization library, where the name represents the 10 letters in between 'l' and 'n' in the word. i18n is an internationalization library, named in the same fashion. There are many of these libraries out there and have been known to be difficult.
