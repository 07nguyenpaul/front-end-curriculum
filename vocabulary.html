        <h2>Vocabulary</h2>
        <br/>
        <p>
          Being familiar with key terms and concepts is a big help in your early days at Turing, so we've put together some vocabulary that will help you be able to 'speak code'.

            <h4>API</h4>
            <p>
              We're building programs that can talk to other programs. Their APIs are their languages. Sort of.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>WYSIWYG</h4>
            <p>
              WYSIWYG stands for "What You See Is What You Get." A WYSIWYG editor allows you to visually see the results as you're editing. A good example of this is the editor in Gmail and other web-based email clients.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>IP Address</h4>
            <p>
              Every server on the web has a unique IP address, which is like a phone number. "63.145.15.99" is an example of an IP address.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Domain</h4>
            <p>Trying to remember the unique IP address for every website on the Internet isn't really a long-term game. Almost all websites have a domain name (e.g. "www.facebook.com") that redirects to their IP address.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Web Server</h4>
            <p>
              A web server is a program that listens for HTTP requests, handles them, and sends responses back to the browser that made the request.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Bugs</h4>
            <p>
              A bug is some kind of error or issue in our program. Back in the days of punch card computers, Grace Hopper found a literal bug in the computer that was causing erroneous results.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>The Cloud</h4>
            <p>
              "The Cloud" is the collective name for a collection of computers on the Internet where you might store data or pictures of your cat.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Command Line</h4>
            <p>
              The command-line is a text-based interface for working with your computer. You can do a whole bunch of chill stuff that there isn't a graphical user interface for.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Version Control</h4>
            <p>
              Version control—most notably, git—allows you to save different versions of your application as you go along. You can even split off for a bit
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Grid Systems</h4>
            <p>
              Just because we're not designers doesn't mean we shouldn't appreciate and respect their grids.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Cookies</h4>
            <p>
              There's probably a pun we could come up with, but we take security seriously.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>404 Error</h4>
            <p>
              The web's best easter egg.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Responsive Design</h4>
            <p>
              Keep your mind like water, but your design should be fluid and screen independent.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>SEO</h4>
            <p>
              Despite what you might read, it's basically just black magic, the dark arts, the voodoo that gives traffic.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Hex</h4>
            <p>
              Because green to you might not be green to me. So there's these really specific codes we use for colors.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>CMS</h4>
            <p>
              All applications are basically just content management systems anyway.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Pseudo Code</h4>
            <p>
              First learn to express yourself. Then learn to code.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>HTTPS</h4>
            <p>
              Insecure content warnings? HTTP Sniffing? Here's why.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Open Source</h4>
            <p>
              It's sort of impossible for me to quantify the impact open source software has made, but at least 64% of the top million websites are powered by it.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>AJAX</h4>
            <p>
              And one day in February 2005, the Internet suddenly felt different.

            <h4>Frontend / Backend</h4>
            <p>
              What's the difference? Turns out, less and less.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Javascript</h4>
            <p>
              The most pervasive and ubiquitous programming language since Flash.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Programming</h4>
            <p>
              It's awesome.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Database</h4>
            <p>
              Just think Excel spreadsheet on crack. Better. We mean better.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>CSS</h4>
            <p>
              We could never love anyone that didn't appreciate the importance of a separation of content and style.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>HTML</h4>
            <p>
              All documents should come in this format.
