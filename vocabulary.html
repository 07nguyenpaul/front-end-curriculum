        <h2>Vocabulary</h2>
        <br/>
        <p>
          Being familiar with key terms and concepts is a big help in your early days at Turing, so we've put together some vocabulary that will help you be able to 'speak code'.

        <ol>
          <li>
            <h4>Domain</h4>
            <p>
              Ever wonder what that thing in the top of the browser is?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>POP &amp; IMAP</h4>
            <p>
              POP, IMAP, SMTP Oh My! It's only email, don't be scared.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>API</h4>
            <p>
              We're building programs that can talk to other programs. Their APIs are their languages. Sort of.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>WYSIWYG</h4>
            <p>
              You can't always get what you want, but sometimes, What You See Is What You Get.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>IP Address</h4>
            <p>
              There's no place like 127.0.0.1, there's no place like 0.0.0.0, there's no place like localhost.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Web Server</h4>
            <p>
              Apache, Puma, Unicorn, Thin, IIS, Mongrel, don't be scared, they are just the beasts behind the world wide web.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Bugs</h4>
            <p>
              The term 'debugging' was coined by Grace Hopper when she literally removed a moth from her computer to get it working.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>DNS</h4>
            <p>
              Finally understand how 74.125.228.4 actually means google.com
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>The Cloud</h4>
            <p>
              It's like instead of your head being in the clouds, it's all your infrastructure.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Command Line</h4>
            <p>
              Live deep in the nix heartland and become a loving extension of the shell.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Version Control</h4>
            <p>
              Rule 1. Never lose code. Rule 2. Never lose code.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Grid Systems</h4>
            <p>
              Just because we're not designers doesn't mean we shouldn't appreciate and respect their grids.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Cookies</h4>
            <p>
              There's probably a pun we could come up with, but we take security seriously.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>404 Error</h4>
            <p>
              The web's best easter egg.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Responsive Design</h4>
            <p>
              Keep your mind like water, but your design should be fluid and screen independent.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>SEO</h4>
            <p>
              Despite what you might read, it's basically just black magic, the dark arts, the voodoo that gives traffic.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Hex</h4>
            <p>
              Because green to you might not be green to me. So there's these really specific codes we use for colors.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>CMS</h4>
            <p>
              All applications are basically just content management systems anyway.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Pseudo Code</h4>
            <p>
              First learn to express yourself. Then learn to code.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>HTTPS</h4>
            <p>
              Insecure content warnings? HTTP Sniffing? Here's why.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Open Source</h4>
            <p>
              It's sort of impossible for me to quantify the impact open source software has made, but at least 64% of the top million websites are powered by it.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>AJAX</h4>
            <p>
              And one day in February 2005, the Internet suddenly felt different.

          <li>
            <h4>Frontend / Backend</h4>
            <p>
              What's the difference? Turns out, less and less.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Javascript</h4>
            <p>
              The most pervasive and ubiquitous programming language since Flash.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Programming</h4>
            <p>
              It's awesome.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Database</h4>
            <p>
              Just think Excel spreadsheet on crack. Better. We mean better.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>CSS</h4>
            <p>
              We could never love anyone that didn't appreciate the importance of a separation of content and style.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>HTML</h4>
            <p>
              All documents should come in this format.
