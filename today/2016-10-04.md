### Homework

New for today:

- **Read** (10 min): [React Patterns](http://reactpatterns.com/)
- **Read** (8 min): [Make Your React Components Pretty](https://medium.com/walmartlabs/make-your-react-components-pretty-a1ae4ec0f56e#.mp5gygxsn). Some thoughts on refactoring React components.
- **Read** (3 min): [You Might Not Need Redux](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/you-might-not-need-redux-be46360cf367#.z9tvrxs7y)

(There is a bit of overlap between the two, but it's two different approaches and I definitely recommend reading them together.)

Carried over from yesterday:

- **Complete**: the official [React Router tutorial](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router-tutorial/tree/master/lessons/01-setting-up). This is based on the older version. This way, you will have some familiarity with each. (Due tomorrow at 4pm.)
- **Watch**: [React Router v4 with Michael Jackson and Ryan Florence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vur2dAFZ4GE). (Due tomorrow at 4pm.)

### Personal Branding I (9:00 - 9:30)

Lia will talk to you about building your personal brand.

### Introduction to Wireframing and Your Personal Site (10:00 - 12:00)

Now that Lia has you all excited about your personal brand, Louisa will walk you through the wireframing process and launch your first (and, ultimately, last) project at Turing: your personal site.

We'll talk about what wireframes are, why we need them, and different types of wireframes. [Lesson here](http://frontend.turing.io/lessons/personal-site-wireframing.html)

Then it's time to get your hands dirty! We'll start ideating and sketching our personal sites.

And finally, we'll split into small groups to discuss and get feedback on our ideas. Use this time to practice fully explaining your thinking, why you've made the layout choices you have, and how this layout approach solves a problem a user of your site might face. As you're discussing, focus on giving solid, constructive feedback to your peers. Ask questions, listen, explain, have a conversation! Small groups are:

- Breana Knight, Eric Sayler, Stephanie Andrews
- Joshua Small, Samuel Johnson, Dylan Avery
- Rebekah Lundy, Justin Wood, Chelle Tuerk
- Jeff Buss, Noah Peden, Devin Marie Beliveau
- Dan Grund, Elijah Williams, Anna Psitos
- Mike Limberg, Adam Rice, Lauren Pesce
- Kenia Farias, Jonathan Willemain, Chaz Gormley
