### Design Time with Louisa (9:00 - 10:30)

This morning Louisa is going to help you add beauty to your world. She'll be taking you on a introductory journey into typography.

We'll have small group critiques of your first Seven (er, Six Weeks of Fonts solutions:

* Adam Bernard, Casey Metz, Madison Kerndt
* Andy Young, David Kerr, MaryJane Valade
* Benjamin Godfrey, Jeff Duke, Mike Sausa
* Blake Worsley, Kirsten Swanson, Paul Nguyen, Kyle Misencik
* Brett Hevia, Kris Foss, Peter Springer, Casey Cross

Things to discuss:

* Does the composition feel balanced?
* Is the typographic treatment enhance the meaning of the quote?
* Does the use of color and/or images enhance or detract from the solution?
* How could it be improved, and in what ways is it successful?
* Did Casey and/or Jeff use blanchedalmond anywhere?

If anyone is feeling brave, we'll go over a couple of solutions together as a whole group.
