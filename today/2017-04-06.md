### Personal Project Kick Off (9:00 - 10:00)

ITS FINALLY HERE!!!

We'll start the day brainstorming ideas as a class, discussing how to avoid pitfalls, and coming up with a plan for the next two weeks.

### Personal Project Planning & Check Ins (10:00 - 4:00)
The rest of the day is yours to start wireframes and research spikes. You are **highly encouraged** to NOT start coding today. Use this time to kick start the deliverables due on Monday (details coming soon).  

Before the end of the day, schedule a time to meet with one of the instructors to pitch your idea and come up with a feasible plan. Details and schedule TBD.  

First deliverables will be due Monday. We will talk about what that means during your one-on-one.
