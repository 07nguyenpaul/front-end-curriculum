Learn about intervals and timeouts with Jhun.

### Introduction to APIs with Node.js (10:00 - 12:00)

Steve will introduce you to APIs with Node.js.

### Bird Feeder in Review (and also Q&A Time)

- Rest parameters and the spread operator
- Classes and `super()`

### Project Work Time (2:00 - 4:00)

Do work, but don't forget to take breaks every 25 minutes or so. Someone should make some kind of application that reminds you.
