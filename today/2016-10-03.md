## Everyone (1606, 1608, 1610)

### State of Turing at Gusto (8:30 - 9:00)

The Turing Team will join us to go over what happened the last module, what's planned for this module, and any other exciting new developments happening at Turing and in our community.

## 1606

### Getting Acquainted in the Space (9:00 - 9:30)

Pioneers! Assemble!

Meet with Steve, Brenna, and a mystery guest at 1331 Market Street.

- Take the elevator to the third floor and make a hard left.
- It's the first room after you make that aforementioned left turn.

We'll spend a little bit of time taking inventory of what we might need/want to do to the space.

### Module 3 Kickoff and Intermission Discussions (9:30 - 10:30)

Meet with your instructors for this module to go over the high-level flow. We'll then transition into answering question from the Node School courses over the break.

### Introduction to the React Router (10:30 - 12:00)

Jesse, a special guest will join us to talk about React Router. He'll be discussing the upcoming version 4.0. We're at a weird place where 4.0 is going to be the official version immenently, but we are still in the final days of the 2.x branch.

### Unit Testing React Components and Other Assignments (1:00 - 4:00)

- **Complete**: the official [React Router tutorial](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router-tutorial/tree/master/lessons/01-setting-up). This is based on the older version. This way, you will have some familiarity with each.
- **Watch**: [React Router v4 with Michael Jackson and Ryan Florence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vur2dAFZ4GE).
- **Complete**: [Learn Redux](https://learnredux.com/) (Due tomorrow at 4pm.)

### Staff Intros (9:00 - 9:30)

Meet the staff you'll interact with the most.

### Orientation (9:30 - 10:00)

Allison will join us to go over some of the ground rules of Turing.

### Being Successful At Turing (10:00 - 11:00)

Turing is an intense and sometimes stressful program full of inspiring, motivating people. We want you to succeed here, so let's talk about what that looks like.

### Personal Goal Setting + Portfolio Planning (11:00 - 11:30)

We'll spend some time digging into your personal goals to help guide your time at Turing.

At the end of each Module, you'll be responsible for completing a small "portfolio" of writing and scores to track how your module went. We'll discuss the details of what this looks like and how you can be working on this from the start of the module so you're not scrambling in the last week.

### Introduction to Mentoring (11:30 - 12:00)

We'll talk about mentoring at Turing.

### Student Introduction Lunch (12:00 - 1:00)

Lunch will be provided, get to know your classmates!

### Computer Setup (1:00 - 2:30)

We'll help you get your system setup so you can hit the ground running in the coming days.
