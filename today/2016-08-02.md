Join Steve as he talks about some of the mind-bending things you can do with functions.

**Disclaimer**: This is one of those introductory talks where we introduce some new stuff at a high-level and then dig deeper over the next few weeks.

### Questions and Answers (10:30 - 12:00ish)

As you come into the final week of your Game Time projects, many of you have common questions on how to approach different features in your game. A lot of these questions overlap, despite the fact that you're all working on wildly different games. Steve will answer your questions as a group.

### Project Work Time and Instructor Pairing (1:00 - 4:00)

All five instructors are on hand.
