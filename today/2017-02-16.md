### Design Challenges: Week 2: The Pivot
Dun Dun Dunnnnn....meet in Clarke Hall.

### Self Directed Project Kickoff & Hackathon (10:00 - Forever)

Today's the day! We'll start off by brainstorming good ideas, talk about pros, cons, approaches, frameworks, problems, and how the next two weeks will go.  

Spend the afternoon starting your research spikes on APIs, wireframing, and fleshing out your ideas. All hands will be on deck to talk through ideas or get you started.  

Deliverables to come.
