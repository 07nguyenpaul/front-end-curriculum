### Project Work Time and Cross-Program Pairing (10:00 - 12:00)

The Module 4 students have some experience with Game Time. This morning, you'll be working together to help with Module 1 students push forward on their games.

Some notes:

1. Most groups are four people (with one group of three). Feel free to split into pairs if it feels right.
2. The Module 1 students should lead the way and explain what features they're working on.
3. If for some reason a pair is absent, feel free to rearrange yourselves.
4. Louisa and Brenna will be on hand as well.

You'll be working in the following groups:

- Chad Ellison & Marina Corona with Jeff Duke & Casey Metz
- Claudia Kiesenhofer with Kirsten Swanson & Madison Kerndt
- Jonathan Bernesser & Jeneve Parrish with Mike Sausa & Kyle Misencik
- Jonathan Liss & Ashwin Rao with Peter Springer & Adam Bernard
