### Pentathlon Week!
It's finals week team! Each day we'll be working through various portions of your summative assesment. As a reminder, your promotion to the next module is evaluated based on the following:

1. Code Challenge #1 (DOM Manipulation)
2. Code Challenge #2 (Basic Problem Solving with vanilla JS)
3. Game Time Evaluation
4. Comprehensive Quizlette
5. Portfolio Defense

### Game Time and/or Portfolio Work Time
When not in an eval, spend your time putting the final touches on your project or polishing that portfolio. :gem:
