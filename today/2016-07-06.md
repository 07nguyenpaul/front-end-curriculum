### Introduction to Responsive Layouts and Media Queries (9:00 - 12:00)

We can't control how our users interact with our products, but we can make sure that our work looks good and functions correctly on all screen sizes. Your product lives online, it's important to make sure that no matter how a user accesses it they are able to use it successfully and without frustration.

Understanding responsive layout strategies, how to use media queries, and when to add breakpoints so your page layout resizes nicely is a critical skill to have in your toolbelt. In this session, we'll be diving into responsive page layouts and using media queries to control your page content at all screen sizes. This lesson has some review and builds on your HTML and CSS fundamentals.

You'll need to clone this workshop's [repository from GitHub][repo].
