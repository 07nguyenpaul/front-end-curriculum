### Project Work Time & Instructor Pairing (ALL. DAY.)  

Be prepared to be called in for a last minute rage-lesson.  

`rage-lesson`:
  Coined From: Steve Kinney  
  Definition: When everyone is confused about the same thing so an instructor spontaneously calls everyone in to do an intense explanation in the middle of work time.  

  (Note: Not actually indicative of the instructor's mood, usually it was just a fast-paced speed-lesson and the word `rage` is fun and dramatic)
