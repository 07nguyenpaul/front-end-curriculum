title: Front-End Curriculum Prework
---

<article>
  <h2 id="before">Prework Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Prework helps provide important context, vocabulary, and baseline of skills to help you hit the ground running on the first day of class. We've found that students who come into the program having invested time in familiarizing themselves with key concepts are able to maximize their early weeks with us.

  <h3>Your Time at Turing</h3>
  <p>If you haven't heard already, Turing is a fast-paced learning environment. Our goal is to prepare you to be a successful, employable web developer be the end of your 4th module. Being as fast paced as it is, the prework is essential to prepare you for your learning at Turing.</p>
  <p>
    Turing isn't just about learning to code. We want to prepare you technically and in professional skills, which includes supporting Turing's mission and vission:
    <blockquote cite="https://www.turing.io/">
      Our mission is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers. Our vision is a world powered by technology where the people building it represent the people using it. We're here to build a movement.
    </blockquote>
  </p>
  <p>For more information about Turing activities and policies, you can read the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mpYj9P8HAVDsxETDH-j6AYyvMSXRzen6WWLFiXN-6BQ/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Turing Student Handbook</a>.</p>

  <h3>What is Front-End Development?</h3>
  <p>
    Front-end development deals with the user facing elements of a website, or the part of the website or software that you interact with. It's the meeting point of design and development, and requires developers to be skilled at writing a blend of HTML (page structure), CSS (styling), and JavaScript (interactivity). Using UX/UI principles, expert understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, front-end developers are a critical part of modern software engineering teams.

  <h3>Learning Goals</h3>
  <p>This prework is spanned across 7 days. It is expected that you spend a few hours of concentrated effort on the tasks for each day - so about 30 hours total. After completing the prework, you should be able to do the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Establish a routine of coding every day</li>
    <li>Be comfortable navigating your development environment and using your tools (Atom, Chrome, the console, and the command line)</li>
    <li>Understand what pieces make up a web application</li>
    <li>Become familiar with some common terminology used in web development</li>
    <li>Develop a basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in order to build a simple, static web page (for show and tell)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If you have more than 7 days (or more than 30 hours) to dedicate to prework, then first complete the 7-day prework tasks, and then continue on to the <a href="#month">month-long prework section</a> that contains additional resources on multple subjects to use as a deeper dive.</p>
  <p>And remember, don't worry if you don't understand 100% of everything. Let's get started!</p>

  <h3>What You'll Need</h3>
  <p>Here are the items you will need to complete the prework:</p>

  <h2>Prework Assignments</h2>

  <article id="week">
    <h3>Daily Warm Up</h3>
    <p>Practice makes perfect, and these daily tasks will help build on your typing and algorithmic thinking skills. Spend 30 minutes total on these every-day tasks.</p>

    <article>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h4><a href="https://typing.io/" target="_blank">typing.io</a></h4>
          <p>Aim for 25 wpm without looking at the keyboard. Focus on JavaScript and jQuery. You would be surprised how many common programming keyboard characters you're not used to typing.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4><a href="https://brilliant.org/computer-science/computer-science/?subtopic=types-and-data-structures" target="_blank">Algorithmic thinking and logic</a></h4>
          <p>Sign up for a free account and work on the free Computer Science Warmups Concepts Challenges at Brilliant.org. Spread these exercises out over the week on each day.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </article>

    <h3>Weeklong Ramp-Up</h3>
    <p>At Turing, you will have to code every single day to stay on top of the workload and build muscle memory for everything you've learned. This 7 days of prework is desgined to get you into that essential routine before day one of class.</p>
    <p>Even if you plan to spend 14 days on this 7-day prework, you should break up the work so that you are doing work and coding every day, even if it is only a little.</p>

          <h4>Computer Setup</h4>
          <p>Before you start practicing with any material on HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, you'll need to get your system set up. Install these programs:</p>
          <article>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <h4 class="full-width"><a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank">Install the Atom text editor</a></h4>
                <p>Atom is a program where we edit code - it is a text editor with many great features that makes editing code more enjoyable. Atom is commonly used in the software development industry.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4 class="full-width"><a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/" target="_blank">Install Google Chrome</a></h4>
                <p>Google Chrome is a web browser that is great for general internet perusing, but web developers like it because it has very useful developer tools (the console), which we will touch on in the prework and use extensively during class.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>Install Xcode</h4>
                <p>Xcode is a huge suite of development tools published by Apple. If we wanted to develop software for the Apple Ecosystem (iPhone apps, macOS apps, etc), we would use Xcode as our editor. But even if we aren’t working in this ecosystem, Xcode provides some system dependencies that we’ll want to have available.</p>
                <p>Download and install Xcode from the Apple App Store - this will probably take a little while to finish. Go get some coffee and eat breakfast...</p>

          <h4>Start a Gist to Track Your Progress</h4>
          <p>A gist is basically a file where you can add text, and the file is tied to your GitHub account. Here is some <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-gists/" target="_blank">more information on gists</a>.</p>
          <p>Here is some documentation about <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-gists/" target="_blank">how to create a gist</a>.</p>
          <p>From your GitHub account, create a public gist with the filename that includes the word "prework" and your name.</p>
