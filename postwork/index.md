#### [30 Day Vanilla JS Coding Challenge](https://javascript30.com/)

Build 30 things in 30 days with 30 tutorials. No frameworks. No compilers. No libraries. No boilerplace.

Make sure your fundamentals don't atrophy.

## Community and Professional Skills

#### Blog

Increase your value as a developer by writing blog posts. Avoid oversharing personal details, use good titles, use refactored code examples and format the post well. Imagine what blog post you had wish you had found when you were googling a problem.

Use a site like [medium.com](https://medium.com/) for hosting so that you have a higher chance of the post being found.

#### Record Videos & Give Talks

If you want to give a conference talk someday, prove that you can do it with a screencast or a tutorial video. Make the videos small and be prepared to record them multiple times.

Upload slides on [speakerdeck](https://speakerdeck.com/) so that you can share them easily.

Join the `#thought-leadership` channel in slack and get advice, lists of upcoming conferences, etc.

[Lanyard.com](http://lanyrd.com/calls/) has a pretty comprehensive list of calls for speakers.
