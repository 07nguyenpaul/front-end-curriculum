### Portfolio Defense (1:00 - 4:00)

You'll have your portofolio reviews in the order below.

There will be two chairs outside of the office labeled "On Deck" and "In The Hole." When a given person is in the office reviewing their portfolio, the person who is up next should be sitting in the "On Deck" chair and the person after that should be in the "In The Hole" seat. This will allow us to conduct portfolio reviews quickly.
