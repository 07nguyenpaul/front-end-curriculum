### Warm Up

Make sure you have the following set up:

- A CodePen account (You'll have to sign up for one and _then_ connect it to your GitHub account if you prefer to log in that way.)
- [Homebrew](http://brew.sh)

### Introduction JavaScript, Episode II: The DOM Strikes Back (9:00 - 11:00)

Meet with Steve as takes you past regular language semantics and into the wonderful world of DOM manipulation for fun and profit.

We'll talk a little bit about the following homework assignment in the beginning:

### Protocol (11:00 - 12:00)

### Homework Discussion (1:00 - 1:30)

We'll be discussing the homework that I know you totally didn't forget about.

- Read "[A Brief History of Markup][hist]" from _[HTML5 for Web Designers][html5]_.
- Read through and work through all of the exercises in [Chapter 3][elo] of _Eloquent JavaScript_.
- Read through and work though Bocoup's [Learn CSS Layout][ll].
- If you haven't already done this as prework, complete Github's [TryGit][] course.

(Nota bene: We postponed the requirement that you push your sites to GitHub, but we're still expecting to see all of the feedback from last week implemented by the end of this week.)
