### Announcements

There are two lunch groups meeting at the Blake Street Campus today:

- Environmental Variables
- Imposter Syndrome Lunch

You have work time late in the morning, so feel free to head out early if you're planning on attending either of these meetings.


### CSS Gradients (9:00 - 10:30)

Join Louisa as she covers the finer points of executing your style ideas with CSS.

Use this information for good, not evil.

### Project Work Time (10:30 - 12:00)

It's time to push forward on your projects today. Make sure to note anything that you'd like to know more about. (See later today.)

### jQuery Question and Answers (1:30 - 2:00)

Steve will answer your jQuery questions and explain any and all topics that might perplex you, with a few caveats:

```js
var question = getStudentQuestion();

if (isClearlyExplainedInJonDuckettBook(question)) {
  return puntOn(question);
}

if (isJustAMatterOfLookingAtTheDocumentation(question)) {
  return puntOn(question);
}

return deliverThoughtfulAnswerTo(question);
```

(Steve reverse the right to also getting around to discussing that reading homework from the weekend.)

### Project Work Time (1:00 - 4:00)

With some questions out of the way, it's time to move forward on your projects. Jhun, Julian, and Louisa are around for you.
