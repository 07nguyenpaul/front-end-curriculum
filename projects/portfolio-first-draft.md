title: Portfolio (First Draft)
---

## Project Requirements

A portfolio site represents you, your personal brand, and is a fantastic opportunity to make a great first impression. For this project, we'll be focusing on how you structure both your content and your HTML & CSS.

Your site must be:

* Easy to navigate
* Clearly organized
* Well written with reusable, DRY CSS and semantic HTML
* Free of Bootstrap or other style guides -- write all your own HTML and CSS

### Content Requirements

It's important that your site have clear, easy to find content that provides a solid overview of your personality, your skills, and your background.

While you can include additional content if you'd like, we feel the content below is necessary to provide a thorough overview:

- primary navigation
- footer
- bio
- past jobs
- education
- goals (*think of this as a mini mission statement. For example, if it is for job hunting then it could be a list of things like "Looking for a collaborative environment"*)
- contact information: github, twitter, *email if you want, or a contact form if you're feeling ambitious*
- list of projects with the following information for each:
    + project name
    + project description/overview
    + tools used/learning highlights from project
    + image(s) of project
    + link to project repo and/or site

We're not going to dictate how you structure your site -- layout and content flow is up to you.

### Content Hierarchy

Carefully consider how you organize your content and how you structure your site. Is there a clear flow through the site? What pieces of information to do want your users to focus on? Is it easy for users to find what they're looking for?

Remember, clarity and usability are important. Simple and clear beats complex and confusing. Your site needs to be pleasant, logical, and easy to use.

### Technical Requirements

- Semantic HTML
- DRY, reusable CSS
- External stylesheets
- Deploy as a gh-pages site
