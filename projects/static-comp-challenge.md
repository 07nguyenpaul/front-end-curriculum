title: Static Comp Challenge 
---

## Specification
The static comp challenge is a series of three weekly challenges to keep you working that HTML/CSS muscle. :muscle: Each week, you'll be given a static comp and asked to recreate it. Don't worry, we'll give you a bit of creative license, however the objective is to build something that respects the integrity of the original design. Once you get into the workforce - building out comps that reflect the designer's choice in layout, spacing, font, imagery, and color to the smallest detail is a requirement.

### Things to Note
 - We have not provided you with any assets, nor native files. You will have to source assets on your own per the creative license guidelines below.
 - We have not provided breakpoint specific comps. You will need to employ some creativity here with a heavy dose of good judgment. Think about how you, as a user, could best experience the content/layout across various screen sizes. Is the content legible? Does the imagery (especially full bleed background images) still make sense and look good? Do portions of the nav become icons (and are they intuitive?), or a menu?

### Requirements

  - Basic site setup with `index.html` and `styles.css`
  - Site must be responsive
  - Post link to your :octocat: repo [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10oLWn4Zjj-jK4hWKpLRGQbshMACoIr1oVayAMvbfjTA/edit#gid=0)
  - Link must be posted by 7:30 AM of the due date

### Creative License
You may NOT take liberties with the layout, but your creative license includes:

* Copy
* Images
* Icons
* Color palette, but ONLY if you select a complementary palette. We highly encourage you to visit sites like: [material palette](https://www.materialpalette.com/) or [coolors](https://coolors.co/) or [color-hex](http://www.color-hex.com/color-palettes/)
