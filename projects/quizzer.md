## Introduction

In this assessment, you'll be fetching and posting quiz data to a server. You'll do part of the project in preparation and then a second part pairing with an instructor.

## Preparation

You can build this assessment project with any of the frameworks or libraries of your choosing. In preparation, clone the [quizzer repo](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/quiz-builder) and follow the installation and setup instructions in README. This will act as the back-end for your quiz application and provide you with the API endpoints you need to hit.

In preparation, create a new front-end application that: 

- fetches quiz data from the back-end provided in the [quizzer repo](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/quiz-builder). Look through the documentation in the README to determine which API endpoints you'll need to request
- displays the quiz and each of its questions & answers

You end up with something that looks like this:

## Setup

You should come to the assessment with both the back-end repo and your front-end app configured and running.

During the assessment, we'll use additional endpoints to POST quiz data to the server and display the results in the UI.
