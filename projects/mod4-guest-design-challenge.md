title: Guest Design Challenge

### Project overview

This is a multi-week Dynamic Comp Challenge. You will be given a comp to build from a guest designer, and the following week they will join us to critique your solutions.

Pay attention to details, sweat the small stuff, and be prepared to speak to the choices you made while building the comp and be able to back them up.

Why do this project and why do it in this format? Because it will help you get ready to work with designers when you land at your first gig. Being able to effectively build a comp is an important part of the job, and getting exposure to the level of detail a designer will notice and correct is going to help you become the developer your creative team wants building their work. You will build empathy and understanding around why you need to follow a comp to the letter, and you will be pushed to explain and fully own your choices around building a layout. And remember: the decisions that go into creating a layout are intentional, deliberate, and important.

### General Requirements:

- You will be provided with a comp, you must match the comp and implement all interactive UI components.  Since guest designers are providing the comps, we may have a range in how comprehensive the comps are. If no mobile comp is provided, we still want it work on small screens and devices and will expect that you use your best judgement to implement a solution for mobile.

- You *do not* need to have a backend and content can be hardcoded, but the dynamic UI elements and interactions should be functional (i.e. carousels should work, etc).

- You must have your solution to the comp be pushed up to GitHub with a working gh-pages site.

- Include a README with the repo that provides a brief overview of the project, and images of both the original comp and your version.

This UI kit is a roller coaster of fun! It's card UI, with graphs and accordion tabs and even carousels happening IN the cards (oh my!).
