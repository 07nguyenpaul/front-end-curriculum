## Project Introduction

As you build more and more projects, you'll begin to notice that you're often building variations of the same page elements. We build lots of nav bars, modals, and tabbed information. Wouldn't it be nice if we had a base template we could refer back to so we could get these elements built even more quickly the next time? Well, good news! We can do just that using a style guide.

## Project Overview

Every week you will be given a specific page element to build. It must be responsive, with HTML, CSS, and (when needed) JS written in a reusable way.
