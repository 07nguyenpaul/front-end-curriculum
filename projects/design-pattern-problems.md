title: Design Pattern Challenges

## Project Introduction

As you build more and more projects, you'll begin to notice that you're often building variations of the same page elements. We build lots of nav bars, modals, tabbed information, and other common layout structures and patterns. On large projects, we may even build the same type of elements numerous times in slightly different ways. The more you do this, the more you notice it. Small inconsistencies in implementation can be a big pain on larger projects, leading to wasted time and a lot of duplication. Wouldn't it be nice if we had a base template we could refer back to so we could get these elements built more quickly and more consistently the next time we need them? Well, good news! We can do just that using a style guide.

As defined by [Brad Frost's Style Guide Best Practices](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/style-guide-best-practices/):"Style guides and pattern libraries are essential tools to help Web teams maintain sanity while creating experiences for our multi-device Web."

## Project Overview

Every week you will be given a specific page element to build. It must be responsive, and the HTML, CSS, and JS must be written in a highly reusable way. The goal is to create a small library of page components that can be quickly and easily dropped into a project with minimal work to integrate them into a codebase.

## Project Requirements

Each week you will be given a new page element to build, and by the end of the module you will have a created a style guide.

## Week One

Design and build a reusable primary navigation bar. It must meet the following criteria:

- be responsive
- have a series of links that is not a dropdown
- have a button (suitable to be used "sign up" or "log out")
- have space for a logo
- responsive layout must have the links shown as a dropdown

Design, styles, and general structure is up to you. The final bar must be straightforward to maintain, user friendly, and easy to drop into a new codebase.
