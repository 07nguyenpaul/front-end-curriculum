## Project Introduction

As you build more and more projects, you'll begin to notice that you're often building variations of the same page elements. We build lots of nav bars, modals, tabbed information, and other common layout structures and patterns. On large projects, we may even build the same type of elements numerous times.

Wouldn't it be nice if we had a base template we could refer back to so we could get these elements built even more quickly the next time? Well, good news! We can do just that using a style guide.

## Project Overview

Every week you will be given a specific page element to build. It must be responsive, and the HTML, CSS, and JS must be written in a highly reusable way. The goal is to create a small library of page components that can be quickly and easily dropped into a project with minimal work to integrate them into a codebase.



## Project Requirements

Each week you will be given a new page element to build, and by the end of the module you will have a created a style guide.
