title: Seven Weeks of Fonts
---

## Project Introduction

Typography is a critical piece of the web design puzzle. At it's most basic, it makes your site easy to read and understand. It can also express emotion, add significant depth and richness to layouts, and guide user's assumptions about the site or product.

The choices a designer makes around typography is calculated, precise, and deeply thought through. It's important to understand and honor this as you build a site that is either based on comps from a designer or as you design a site yourself.

To help us gain a better understanding of how we can use typography and fonts as a tool for visual expression, we will be doing a variation of a common [Intro to Typography exercise](type1) that helps enforce that type can be used as a visual communication tool which enhances [the meaning and emotion](type1-desc) of the content beyond simply spelling out words.

## Project Overview

Manipulating type in expressive, creative ways is an interesting CSS layout challenge, and developing the skill of choosing fonts that pair nicely together takes time. Drawing inspiration from the [Yale School of Art's](yaleart) [100 Days](100days-yale) project, we'll build a new typographic experiment every week for this module. The end deliverable will be a one page site that shows each of your type examples. Take a look at this [100 Days of Fonts](100days) project by designer [Do-Hee Kim](do-hee) as an amazing example of what a final deliverable might look like.

To help build typography and layout skills simultaneously, we'll make our challenges revolve around working with pre-selected font pairings and text snippets. These will be provided to you, and your job will be to make a responsive and expressive layout using them. What feelings does the copy convey and how do you express that typographically? How can that be communicated through layout, scale, and color?
