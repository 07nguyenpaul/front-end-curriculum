title: Seven Weeks of Fonts
---

## Project Introduction

Typography is a critical piece of the web design puzzle. At it's most basic, it makes your site easy to read and understand. It can also express emotion, add significant depth and richness to layouts, and guide user's assumptions about the site or product.

The choices a designer makes around typography and calculated, precise, and deeply thought through. It's important to understand and honor this as you build a site based on comps or as you design a site your self.

To help us gain a better understanding of how we can use typography and fonts as a tool for visual expression, we will be doing a variation of a common [Intro to Typography exercise](type1) that helps enforce that type can be used as a visual communication tool which [enhances the meaning and emotion](type1-desc) of the content beyond simply spelling out words.

## Project Requirements

Manipulating type in expressive, creative ways is an interesting CSS layout challenge, and developing the skill of choosing fonts that pair nicely together takes time. Drawing inspiration from the [Yale School of Art](yaleart) design program's [100 Days](100days-yale) project, we'll build a new typographic experiment every week for this module. The end deliverable will be a one page site that shows each  

To help build both of these skills simultaneously, we'll make our challenges revolve around working with pre-selected font pairings and text snippets. These will be provided to you, and your job will be to make a responsive and expressive layout using them. What does feelings does the copy convey? How can that be communicated through layout, scale, and color?
