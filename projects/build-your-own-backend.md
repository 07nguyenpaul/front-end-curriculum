title: Build Your Own Backend
module: 4
---

## Abstract

In this project you'll build a backend in Node, Express and Knex.

## Base Expectations

### API Structure & Best Practices

In the README, developer should provide documentation on the API endpoints that can be hit. This can be as simple as just listing all endpoints (and accepted params) with explanation of responses. Here is a [great example of in depth documentation](https://github.com/500px/api-documentation/blob/master/README.md)

Your README documentation needs to include information on how the API structure was generated by the developer based on reviewing the JSON API standard http://jsonapi.org/format/

Note: The developer does not HAVE to follow the JSON API standard but they must be able to identify and justify when/why they did not

### Required endpoints

* 6 GET endpoints
  * 3 GET endpoints for all of one resource (i.e. '/api/v1/merchants')
  * 3 GET endpoints for a specific resource (i.e. '/api/v1/merchants/:id')
* 3 POST endpoints
* 3 PUT endpoints
* 3 DELETE endpoints

### Status Codes

All endpoint should respond with the minimum status code results:

* 200: Success
* 404: Not Found

If POST request fails to save an entity due to bad information being sent to it, you should respond with

* 422: Unprocessable Entity

If you have a critical server error, you should respond with

* 500: Internal Server Error

You are welcome to use other status codes.

All of the above scenarios (other than the 500 error) should be tested per endpoint.


### Custom API Endpoints

* Developer must have at least one endpoint that calculates a total number of something.

For example, if you provided and endpoint of merchants, you would want an endpoint that provides the total revenue per merchant.

 `GET /api/v1/merchants/:id/revenue`

The actual implementation will depend on your data set, but the goal is that you have an endpoint that does backend calculations on your data and serves it up (taking some of the weight off of whatever front-end you use.

* Developer must use GET params on at least one endpoint, which would allow the user to narrow down the nature of their request. You will typically see this on something like an index. So for example, you may have an endpoint like:

`GET api/v1/merchants?areacode=80202`

Which would limit the results to being merchants in the 80202 area code.

A further example of this implementation can be found here: [params](https://scotch.io/tutorials/use-expressjs-to-get-url-and-post-parameters)

### Sources of Data

Data source MUST BE LOCKED IN by Tuesday (3/21) EOD . We don't want you wasting the whole week trying to find data. Having production API endpoints well tested

Possible sources of data:

* Rebuild a backend from your personal project
* Work with and scrape new data from an API. Some APIs are easier to work with than others - you may not be able to pull off the thing you want to do - be prepared for that.
  * https://developer.nrel.gov/
  * https://sunlightfoundation.com/api/
  * https://developer.foursquare.com/
  * data.world
* Parse CSVs or JSON files (Node has built-in modules for parsing CSVs)
* Create the data yourself. You must create a ‘seed file’ with a minimum of 30 rows of data for each main table

### Relationships

At minimum, you must have at least 1 relationship with two or more tables

## Instructor Evaluation Points

The following set of points are distributed at the discretion of the instructor.

### Data Persistence with SQL Database

* **20 points** - The application persists data in a SQL database but with correct relationships between folders and URLs.
* **10 points** - The application persists data in a SQL database but with some incorrect relationships between folders and URLs.
* **0 points** - The application does not persist data in a SQL database.

### Testing

* **20 points** - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels including server and client tests.
* **15 points** - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All controller actions are covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.
* **7 points** - Project has sporadic use of tests and multiple levels. Not all controller actions are tested. There are little or no attempts at integration testing.
* **0 points** - There is little or no evidence of testing in this application.

### JavaScript Style

* **20 points** - Application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or no duplication and all components separated out into logical components. There _zero_ instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.
* **15 points** - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
* **12 points** - Your application has some duplication and minor bugs. Developer can speak to most choices made in the code and knows what every line is doing.
* **8 points** - Your application has a significant amount of duplication and one or more major bugs. Developer cannot speak to most choices and does not know what every line of code is doing.
* **3 point** - Your client-side application does not function or the application does not make use of AJAX using jQuery for updating information on the client. Developer writes code with unnecessary variables, operations, or steps which do not increase clarity.
* **0 points** - There is little or no client-side code. Developer writes code that is difficult to understand. Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together.

### Workflow

* **20 points** - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.
* **15 points** - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.
* **7 points** - The developer makes large commits covering multiple features that make it difficult for the evaluator to determine the evolution of the application.
* **0 points** - The application was not checked into version control.

## Projects are due on Friday 3/24, 1:00 p.m. We will provide a submission form for all teams to submit their repos.

## Project is worth 100 points

## To get a 3 on this project, you need to score 70 points or higher

## To get a 4 on this project, you need to score 90 points or higher

# Final Score: x / 100
