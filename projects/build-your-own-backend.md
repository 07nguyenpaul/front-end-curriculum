module: 4
---

## Abstract

In this project you'll build a backend in Node, Express and Knex.

## Base Expectations

* 6 GET endpoints
  * 3 GET endpoints for all of one resources (i.e. '/animals')
  * 3 GET endpoints for a specific resource (i.e. '/animals/:id')
* 3 POST endpoints
* 3 PUT endpoints
* 3 DELETE endpoints

## Instructor Evaluation Points

The following set of points are distributed at the discretion of the instructor.

### Data Persistence with SQL Database

* **20 points** - The application persists data in a SQL database but with correct relationships between folders and URLs.
* **10 points** - The application persists data in a SQL database but with some incorrect relationships between folders and URLs.
* **0 points** - The application does not persist data in a SQL database.

### Testing

* **20 points** - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels including server and client tests.
* **15 points** - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All controller actions are covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.
* **7 points** - Project has sporadic use of tests and multiple levels. Not all controller actions are tested. There are little or no attempts at integration testing.
* **0 points** - There is little or no evidence of testing in this application.

### JavaScript Style

* **20 points** - Application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or no duplication and all components separated out into logical components. There _zero_ instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.
* **15 points** - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
* **12 points** - Your application has some duplication and minor bugs. Developer can speak to most choices made in the code and knows what every line is doing.
* **8 points** - Your application has a significant amount of duplication and one or more major bugs. Developer cannot speak to most choices and does not know what every line of code is doing.
* **3 point** - Your client-side application does not function or the application does not make use of AJAX using jQuery for updating information on the client. Developer writes code with unnecessary variables, operations, or steps which do not increase clarity.
* **0 points** - There is little or no client-side code. Developer writes code that is difficult to understand. Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together.

### Workflow

* **20 points** - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.
* **15 points** - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.
* **7 points** - The developer makes large commits covering multiple features that make it difficult for the evaluator to determine the evolution of the application.
* **0 points** - The application was not checked into version control.
