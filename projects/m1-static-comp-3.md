title: Static Comp Challenge 3
---

## Specification
The static comp challenge is a series of three challenges to keep you working that HTML/CSS muscle. :muscle: You will be asked to recreate a static comp, with each growing in complexity. For each challenge, you'll be given a static comp and asked to recreate it. Don't worry, we'll give you a bit of creative license, however the objective is to build something that respects the integrity of the original design. Once you get into the workforce - building out comps that reflect the designer's choice in layout, spacing, font, imagery, and color to the smallest detail is a requirement.

### Things to Note
 - We have not provided you with any assets, nor native files. You will have to source assets on your own per the creative license guidelines below.
 - We have not provided breakpoint specific comps. You will need to employ some creativity here with a heavy dose of good judgment. Think about how you, as a user, could best experience the content/layout across various screen sizes. Is the content legible? Does the imagery (especially full bleed background images) still make sense and look good? Do portions of the nav become icons (and are they intuitive?), or a menu?

### Creative License
You may NOT take liberties with the layout, but your creative license includes:

* Copy
* Images
* Icons
* Color palette, but ONLY if you select a complementary palette. We highly encourage you to visit sites like: [material palette](https://www.materialpalette.com/) or [coolors](https://coolors.co/) or [color-hex](http://www.color-hex.com/color-palettes/)

### Base Requirements

  - Basic static site setup with `index.html` and `styles.css`
  - Site must be responsive
  - Create a repo on github :octocat: for your work with following naming construct: [initials]-comp-challenge-[challenge number] (i.e. __"bt-comp-challenge-1"__)
  - Add your instructors as collaborators to the repo (:octocat: breethomas, :octocat: robbiejaeger, :octocat: LouisaBarrett)
  - Include a README with the repo that provides a brief overview of the project, and images of both the original comp and your version.
  - Push your final work to [github pages](https://pages.github.com/)

### Additional Requirements

  - This final challenge is a part of your portfolio
  - Note the rubric below for evaluation criteria

***

## Evaluation Rubric

### Design Integrity

- 4: The comp beautifully articulates the original design intent and there are no areas where an instructor would make changes with respect to color, layout, imagery, spatial relationship of graphical elements.
- 3: The comp accurately reflects the design integrity with respect to color, layout, imagery, spatial relationship of graphical elements. While there are areas of improvement, it is a close representation of the original design.
- 2:  The comp is missing major design elements and/or incorrectly applies design with respect to any number of major deviations across color, layout, sizing, imagery, graphical spatial relationships.
- 1:  The comp fails to respect the original comp layout and visual hierarchy intent. In addition, but not limited to, it fails to employ complementary color palette, and/or is missing major design elements.

### Responsive Layout

- 4: The comp is fully responsive and there are no areas where the instructor would make changes.
- 3:  The comp logically breaks down across several breakpoints to accommodate mobile, tablet, desktop, and large format screens. While there are areas for improvement, nothing is lost or illegible across any of the screen sizes.
- 2:  The comp fails to employ multiple breakpoints and the design is severely compromised at either extreme of small (mobile) or large (flat screen) size.
- 1:  The comp is not responsive at any size.

### HTML Style

- 4: Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors.
- 3:  Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing. Developer employs basic use of semantic tags and makes additional effort where applicable to write accessible markup.
- 2:  Developer writes effective HTML, but does not write semantically correct and clearly organized code. Application shows some effort to use semantically correct HTML, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear. There are many un-semantic tags and unnecessary selectors and it is not clear to the evaluator what a given section of code represents visually. Developer cannot speak to every line of code.
- 1:  Developer writes code with unnecessary tags, selectors, or nesting that do not increase clarity. Developer writes code that is difficult to understand. Application markup shows poor structure with no understanding of semantics.

### CSS Style

- 4: Application has exceptionally well-factored CSS with little or no duplication and all styles separated out into logical stylesheets. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.
- 3:  Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.
- 2:  Your application has some duplication and minor bugs. Developer can speak to most choices made in the code and knows what every line is doing.
- 1:  Your application has a significant amount of duplication and one or more major bugs. Developer cannot speak to most choices and does not know what every line of CSS is doing. Developer writes code with unnecessary selectors or tags which do not increase clarity.
